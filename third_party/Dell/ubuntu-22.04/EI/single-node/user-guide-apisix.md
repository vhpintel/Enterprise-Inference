## Overview
This guide walks you through the setup and deployment of **Intel® AI for Enterprise Inference** in a **single-node** environment.  
It is designed for new users who may not be familiar with server configuration or AI inference deployment.

**You’ll Learn How To:**

- Prepare your system environment
- Set up SSH, DNS, SSL/TLS, and Hugging Face tokens
- Run automated scripts for Intel® Gaudi® accelerators
- Deploy and test the inference stack on a single node  

---

## Prerequisites
Before starting the deployment, ensure your system meets the following requirements.

### 1. System Requirements
  		
| Requirement | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| **Operating System** | Ubuntu 22.04 LTS |
| **Access** | Root or sudo privileges |
| **Network** | Internet connection for package installation  |
| **Optional Accelerator SW Versions**  |  Intel® Gaudi® AI Accelerator hardware (for GPU workloads)  |
|  - **HL-SMI Version (hl)**  |  ≥1.21.3  |
|  -  **Firmware Version (fw)**  | 61.0.2.0  |
|  -  **SPI / Preboot Firmware (Gaudi3**)  | ≥1.22.0-fw-61.3.2-sec-3  |
|  -  **Driver Version** |  ≥1.21.3-f063886 |
|  -  **NIC Driver Version**  | ≥1.21.3-94c920f  |
|  -  **Habana Container Runtime** |  ≥ 1.21.3  |

#### Sudo Setup

Ensure `sudo` preserves `/usr/local/bin` in the PATH. Execute the following to check that `/usr/local/bin` is in /etc/sudoers `secure_path`:

```bash
$ sudo cat /etc/sudoers | grep secure_path
Defaults    secure_path = /sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin
```

If you do NOT see `/usr/local/bin`, use `sudo visudo` to edit the sudoers file and append it as you see in the sample output above.

### 2. SSH Key Setup
SSH keys are required to allow **Ansible** or automation scripts to connect securely to your nodes.

1. **Generate a new SSH key pair:**
    ```bash
    ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096
    ```

    - Press '**Enter**' to accept defaults.
    - You can name your key if desired.
    - Leave the password field blank.

2. **Distribute the public key:**

    Copy the contents of your `id_rsa.pub` file to authorized_keys:
    ```bash
    echo "<PUBLIC_KEY_CONTENTS>" >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
    ```

3. **Verify access:**

    Test SSH connectivity:
    ```bash
    chmod 600 <path_to_PRIVATE_KEY>
    ssh -i <path_to_PRIVATE_KEY> <USERNAME>@<IP_ADDRESS>
    ```

### 3. DNS and SSL/TLS Setup

1. **Generate a self-signed certificate:**

    Use OpenSSL to generate a temporary certificate:
    ```bash
    mkdir -p ~/certs && cd ~/certs
    openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -days 365 -nodes -subj "/CN=api.example.com"
    ```

    This will generate:
    `cert.pem` → certificate
    `key.pem` → private key

  > **Note:**  
  > `api.example.com` is used throughout this guide as a sample.
  > Replace it with **your own fully qualified domain name (FQDN)** wherever it appears.

2. **Map your DNS to your local IP (only if not registered in DNS):**

    If your domain is not registered in DNS, you can map it manually by editing your /etc/hosts file
    ```bash
    hostname -I   # Get your machine's private IP
    sudo nano /etc/hosts
    ```
 
    Add this line:
    ```bash
    127.0.0.1 api.example.com
    ```

    Save and exit with CTRL+X → Y → Enter.

  > **Note:** Replace api.example.com with the URL used to generate certs in above step , and this manual mapping is only required if your machine’s hostname is not resolvable via DNS.
  > If your domain is already managed by a DNS provider, skip this step.

### 4. Hugging Face Token Setup
  1. Visit huggingface.com and log in (or create an account).
  2. Go to **Settings → Access** Tokens.
  3. Click “**New Token**”, enter a name, and copy the generated value.
  4. Store it securely — you’ll need it for deployment.

## Single Node Deployment Guide
This section explains how to deploy Intel® AI for Enterprise Inference on a single Ubuntu 22.04 server.

**Prerequisites**
- Ubuntu 22.04 server ready
- Root or sudo access

---

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/opea-project/Enterprise-Inference.git
cd Enterprise-Inference
git checkout ${RELEASE}
```
> **Note:** Update the RELEASE environment variable to point to the desired Enterprise Inference version(for example: release-1.4.0)

---

### 2. Configure the Setup Files and Environment

**Update inference-config.cfg:**

```bash
vi core/inventory/inference-config.cfg
```

> **Note:** Update configuration files for single node apisix deployment, Below are the changes needed.
> * Replace cluster_url with your DNS , it must match with DNS used in certs generation.
> * Set keycloak `keycloak_client_id` `keycloak_admin_user` `keycloak_admin_password` values
> * Add your Hugging Face token
> * Set the cpu_or_gpu value to "cpu" for Xeon models and "gaudi3" for Intel Gaudi 3 accelerator models
> * Set deploy_keycloak_apisix to on and Set deploy_genai_gateway to off


```
cluster_url=api.example.com
cert_file=~/certs/cert.pem
key_file=~/certs/key.pem
keycloak_client_id=my-client-id  
keycloak_admin_user=your-keycloak-admin-user   
keycloak_admin_password=changeme 
hugging_face_token=your_hugging_face_token
hugging_face_token_falcon3=your_hugging_face_token
models=
cpu_or_gpu=gaudi3
vault_pass_code=place-holder-123
deploy_kubernetes_fresh=on
deploy_ingress_controller=on
deploy_keycloak_apisix=on
deploy_genai_gateway=off
deploy_observability=off
deploy_llm_models=on
deploy_ceph=off
deploy_istio=off
uninstall_ceph=off
```

To support non-interactive execution of inference-stack-deploy.sh, create a file named "core/inentory/.become-passfile" with your user's sudo password:

```bash
vi core/inentory/.become-passfile
chmod 600 core/inentory/.become-passfile
```
**Update hosts.yaml File**

Copy the single node preset hosts config file to the working directory:
```bash
cp -f docs/examples/single-node/hosts.yaml core/inventory/hosts.yaml
```
> Note: The ansible_user field is set to ubuntu by default. Change it to the actual username used.


### 3. Run the Deployment

> **Note:**
> The `--models` argument selects a model using its **numeric ID**  
> If `--models` is omitted, the installer displays the full model list and prompts you to select a model interactively.

Run the setup for Gaudi 

```bash
cd core
chmod +x inference-stack-deploy.sh
./inference-stack-deploy.sh --models "1" --cpu-or-gpu "gaudi3"
```

Run the setup for CPU

```bash
cd core
chmod +x inference-stack-deploy.sh
./inference-stack-deploy.sh --models "21" --cpu-or-gpu "cpu"
```

When prompted, choose option **1) Provision Enterprise Inference Cluster** and confirm **Yes** to start installation.
If using Intel® Gaudi® hardware, make sure firmware and drivers are updated before running this script.

### 4. Verify the Deployment

Verify Pods Status
```bash
kubectl get pods -A
```
Expected States:
- All pods Running
- No CrashLoopBackOff
- No Pending pods

verify routes
```bash
kubectl get apisixroutes
```

---

### 5. Test the Inference

**Obtain Access Token**

Before generating the access token, ensure all Keycloak-related values are correctly set in the `Enterprise-Inference/core/scripts/generate-token.sh` and these values must match with keycloak values in `Enterprise-Inference/core/inventory/inference-config.cfg` .

```bash
cd Enterprise-Inference/core/scripts
chmod +x generate-token.sh
./generate-token.sh
```

**Verify the Token**

After the script completes successfully, confirm that the token is available in your shell:

```bash
echo $TOKEN
```

If a valid token is returned (long JWT string), the environment is ready for inference testing.

**Run a test query for Gaudi:**
> Note: Replace ${BASE_URL} with your DNS

```bash
curl -k ${BASE_URL}/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct/v1/completions \
-X POST \
-d '{"model": "meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct", "prompt": "What is Deep Learning?", "max_tokens": 25, "temperature": 0}' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

**Run a test query for CPU:**
```bash
curl -k ${BASE_URL}/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-vllmcpu/v1/completions \
-X POST \
-d '{"model": "meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct", "prompt": "What is Deep Learning?", "max_tokens": 25, "temperature": 0}' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```


If successful, the model will return a completion response.
